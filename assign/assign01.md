Your Task

Your task is to propose a group project that your team will work on. Your team must choose a project in which you will design and implement a substantial software system.

Write a 1 to 2 page report describing the project. The report should include the following information:

-   Who are the members of your group? Your group should have at least 3 members, but not more than 5.
-   What problem is solved by the system your group will implement?
-   What are the major technical challenges you will face?
-   What technologies (programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware devices, etc.) will you use in the implementation of the system?
-   What kind of user interface will the system have?

Use diagrams as appropriate to convey this information clearly.
