**Due: Monday, Sept 15th by 11:00 AM**

This is a **Team** assignment.

Your Task
---------

Your task is to create a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository.

The repository should contain labels for:

-   **Feature (light blue)** - indicates a planned feature to be implemented
-   **Bug (red)** - indicates a problem with code that needs to be addressed
-   **In-progress (green with individual initials)** - one per group member indicating which tasks are currently being worked on.

Your group may add additional labels as desired.

### Milestones

Milestones should be created for the following system states:

-   **Minimal Working System (Monday, October 6th)** - this milestone will include the core object model classes and corresponding unit test framework for the system. It should also include a basic functional user interface (possibly console based) to demonstrate functionality.
-   **50% Working System (Monday, November 3rd)** - this milestone will expand the minimal working system to include additional functionality and an initial graphical interface
-   **Final Working System (Wednesday, December 10th)** - this milestone should demonstrate all the features of the complete and integrated system

### Issues

Consider creating initial issues that correspond to the features of the system, i.e. the tasks necessary for implementing each system requirement. Each requirements may consist of multiple issues. Be sure to add a description to each issue explaining the functionality and requirement the issue will address.

Each milestone should then be assigned appropriate issues describing the features the milestone will implement. Begin with general features, but as a feature is undertaken new detailed issues should be added to the issue tracker documenting the evolution of the system design architecture.

Be sure that as progress on the project proceeds, issues are labeled appropriately and at least weekly comments are added describing work that was accomplished.
